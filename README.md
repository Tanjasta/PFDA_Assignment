# PFDA_Assignment


Programming for Data Analysis Assignment

## Task

Task for this Assignment is create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon.

• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.


## Description
This project presents a simulation of a dataset that illustrates the relationship among study load, sleep quality, academic performance, and stress levels of students. To achieve this, a set of data points representing real-life scenarios and patterns observed in actual situations was generated. This process involved creating a dataset that reflects the correlations between study load, sleep quality, academic performance, and stress levels.
